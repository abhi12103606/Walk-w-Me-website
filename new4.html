        <h3 id="head2">TRAINING TO WALK A MARATHON</h3>
												<p id="data">	There are many different marathon <a href="http://thewalkingsite.com/marathonwalking/trainingplans.html">training plans</a>
 available. Most start with a base of approximately 15 - 20 miles a 
week. This means that you have already been walking about 20 miles a 
week and are capable of walking 4 miles several times a week with a 
longer walk once a week.</p>
                                                    <p id="data">	If you are a <a href="http://thewalkingsite.com/beginner.html">beginner walker</a>
 you will need to do less mileage until you have built a good base. The 
longer you have to build this base the better. It is usually recommended
 that one have a minimum of six to twelve months walking experience 
prior to beginning a marathon training program. Your mucles, bones, and 
joints need sufficient time to adapt to walking prior to the stress of 
adding mileage.</p>
                                                    <p id="data">	A good training program usually consist of 4 to 6 days of 
walking each week. Regardless of the schedule, it should provide variety
 and a gradual increase in mileage. If possible include the following in
 your weekly schedule:</p>
													
 <h3 id="head2">One day of speed intervals</h3>
                                                    <p id="data">One day a week practice
 speed by doing short intervals at a fast pace, resting (walk at a 
comfortable pace) between intervals. If you have never incorporated 
speed intervals into your routine you should start out by doing 
fartleks. These are untimed intervals of faster paced and comfortable 
paced walking. Once you are more experienced you can move on to one 
minute fast, 2 minutes slow, and gradually build to 2 minutes fast, one 
minute slow, etc.. ALWAYS warm up well before doing any speed work.</p>
<h3 id="head2">One day at a faster pace (tempo walk)</h3>
<p id="data">A tempo walk
 is a steady state fast workout. Push yourself a little this day, but 
don't push so hard you can not complete the scheduled distance. Your 
pace will not be as fast as your speed intervals, but faster than 
"comfortble" pace. Be sure to warm well at the beginning of your 
workout. <p id="data"></p>
													
<h3 id="head2">One long distance day (LSD)</h3> 
                                                    <p id="data">These distance 
building walks should be done at a comfortable pace...faster than easy, 
but slow enough to comfortably finish the distance. Some schedules call 
for alternating your weekly long distance walk with a slightly shorter 
distance every other week. The alternating weeks are not as long, but a 
little faster. As you get closer to the marathon these shorter distance 
walks should be done at your marathon goal pace.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Recovery walk (EZ) </h3>
<p id="data">The three walks above are the 
basic training walks. If possible add one to two recovery days. These 
are easy walks done at a comfortable pace focusing on walking with 
perfect form.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Crosstraining (CT)</h3>
<p id="data">Keep your body moving with 
aerobic crosstraining. This will rest your walking muscles, while 
strengthening muscles not used during walking. Crosstraining once or 
twice each week will improve your overall fitness level, endurance, and 
strength.</p>
<h3 id="head2">One day off each week</h3>
<p id="data">You are stressing your body when adding mileage, take one to two rest days each week.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Listen to your body.</h3> <p id="data">If you need an extra day off take it. It is better to miss a day of training than a week.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Warm up and stretching</h3><p id="data">Every workout should begin with a <a href="new6.html">warm up,</a>
 and end with a cool down. Spend a bit more time with your warm up on 
speed training days and be sure to incorporate some dynamic flexibility 
exercises.</p>
<p id="data">After you workout you must also spend 
time stretching. The harder or longer you workout the more time you 
should spend on your stretching routine.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Taper</h3><p id="data">A marathon training plan should also include
 a taper period. This is a time prior to the marathon when mileage 
decreases allowing your body to rest and rebuild. Most marathon 
schedules will have the last and longest walk two to three weeks prior 
to the marathon and decrease mileage each week until marathon day.</p>
													
													<h3 id="head2">Strength Training</h3><p id="data">I also encourage all walkers to include <a href="http://thewalkingsite.com/strength.html">strength training</a>
 in their training program. If you are new to strength training take it 
easy in the beginning. A few easy strength training exercises twice a 
week is a good start.</p>
