    neglected by walkers and runners, or done incorrectly. However 
    incorporating these elements into your workout routine will make 
    workouts easier, improve performance, and decrease your risk of cramps 
    and injury.</p>
    <h3 id="head2">Every workout should be performed in the following sequence:</h3>
    <p id="data">1) Warm up with easy paced walking and/or dynamic flexibility exercises<br>
                                                        2) Walk or crosstrain at your desired pace<br>
                                                        3) Cool down<br>

    <p id="data">Warming up is exercising at a lower intensity in order to get the blood circulating 
    and let your body know that you are preparing for exercise. You can warm
     up by walking and gradually increasing your pace over a period of about
     ten minutes. The faster you plan to walk the more time you will need to
     dedicate to your warm up. There are many different dynamic flexibility 
    exercises that can be used as part of your warm up. Here are a few to 
    try:</p>
                                                        <span class="text"><i>Toe points</i> --</span> <span class="text2">Stand on one leg and lift the other 
    foot off the floor. Gently point your toe and hold for a few seconds. 
    Next flex your foot pointing your toes up. Do this five or ten times on 
    each foot.</span><br>
    <br>
                                                        <span class="text"><i>Ankle Circles</i> --</span> <span class="text2">While standing on one leg lift the 
    other foot off the floor. Gently point your toe and rotate your ankle. 
    Do about ten circles in each direction. This exercise can be performed 
    while standing, sitting, or lying on your back with leg raised.</span><br>
    <br>
                                                        <span class="text"> <i>Overhead Reach</i>--</span> <span class="text2">Stand with your feet hip distance 
    apart. Reach up with one arm and then reach over your head and to the 
    opposite side. Keep your hips steady and your shoulders straight. Relax 
    and repeat with the other side.</span><br>
    <br>
                                                        <span class="text"><i>The Twist</i> --</span> <span class="text2">Stand with your feet shoulder width 
    apart and your arms straight out, parallel to ground. Keep your lower 
    body stationary while swinging your arms from side to side. Do this 
    several times to loosen up your waist, back, and shoulders.</span><br>
    <br>
                                                        <span class="text"><i>Arm Circles</i> --</span> <span class="text2">Hold your arms straight out to your 
    side parallel to the ground. Make small circles going backward, 
    gradually getting larger and larger. Rest for a second and do the same 
    thing in the forward direction.</span><class="text2"
                                                        <p id="data">As you improve your pace you may wish to include more 
    flexibility exercises into your routine. This becomes more important on 
    your fast/hard workout days. For more flexibility exercises and drills

    be ready to complete your walk at your normal walking pace. For the 
    first few weeks do not push too hard. Your 
    breathing should be elevated, but you should not be gasping for air. A 
    rule of thumb that works for most people is... If you can not talk you 
    are walking too fast, if you can carry a tune you are walking too slow.</p>
                                                        <h3 id="head2"><b>4) Cool down</b></h3><p id="data">At the end of your walk you need to 
    walk at a slower pace to cool down. The harder you have worked out the 
    longer you should cool down. In the beginning your walks are very short 
    and you only need to cool down a couple of minutes. As your walking time
     and intensity extends so should your cool down period.</p>
                                                        <h3 id="head2"><b>5) Stretch</b></h3><p id="data">Start off right and take the time to 
    stretch AFTER every workout. In the beginning your total post walk 
    stretching routine should take about 5 minutes. As you increase distance
                                                        <br>
                                                        The stretches we recommend post workout are called static 
    stretches. These are stretches where you gently go into the stretch and 
    hold the position. There are so many stretches it is impossible to cover
     them all. Be sure to stretch all the major muscle groups, and put extra
     focus on problem areas. Find a few recommended stretches below:</p><br>

    your toes on a step or curb. Hold on to something for balance. Remove 
    your left foot and slowly allow the right heel to move down. Hold this 
    position. Be sure to keep you body upright and straight. Release and 
    repeat on the other side.<br>
                                                        <br>

    Take a big step forward with your left foot, keeping you right heel on 
    the ground. Hold the position and repeat on the other side. Be sure to 
    keep your body upright and your abs tight, do not arch your back.<br>

    up, hold on to a stationary object. Stand with your weight on one leg 
    and straighten it. Place your other foot on the ground, with toes

    touching the ground, roll your foot and leg forward, from the ankle.

    hand on your thigh and gently pull it over to your left side. Do not 
    pull at the knee. Your shoulders, left leg and back should remain flat.

    on a hard surface...it may bruise the spine!<br>

    Standing up, hold on to a stationary object. Bend your right knee, 
    bringing your foot toward your buttocks. Keeping your left knee slightly
     bent, grasp your right ankle with the opposite hand. Slowly pull your 
    leg up and back, bringing your foot at high as comfortable. Repeat with 
    other leg. (To protect your knee... think of pulling the quads back 
    rather than pulling the foot toward your buttocks.)<br>

                                                    <span class="text2">1) Never perform static stretches 
    on cold muscles. The best time for this type of stretching is after your
     walk. If you have a problem area that needs stretching prior to your 
    walk then you should do that stretching AFTER a complete warm up.<br>
                                                        <br>

    stretch slowly and hold gently. Stretch to the point of feeling a gentle
     pull, but never to the point of pain<br>
                                                        <br>

    seconds. If you have problems with a particular area stretch that area 
    twice. (Hold for 30-40 seconds release, then stretch again.)<br>
